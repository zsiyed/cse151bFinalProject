    "Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. ",
    "Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't. ",
    "Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. ",
    "Let your hopes, not your hurts, shape your future. ",

    "They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. ",
    "Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. ",
    "Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the little voice at the end of the day that says I'll try again tomorrow. ",
    "Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver. ",
    "If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  ",
    "Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently. ",
    "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen. ",
    "Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. ",
    "In the time we have it is surely our duty to do all the good we can to all the people we can in all the ways we can.  ",
    "To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. ",

    "When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. ",
    "When someone steals another's clothes, we call them a thief. Should we not give the same name to one who could clothe the naked and does not? The bread in your cupboard belongs to the hungry; the coat unused in your closet belongs to the one who needs it; the shoes rotting in your closet belong to the one who has no shoes; the money which you hoard up belongs to the poor. ",
    "Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others. ",
    "Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good. ",
    "You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for our own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful. ",
    "I am only one, but I am one.  I cannot do everything, but I can do something.  And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do. ",
    "Gracious acceptance is an art\u2014an art which most never bother to cultivate. We think that we have to learn how to give, but we forget about accepting things, which can be much harder than giving... Accepting another person's gift is allowing him to express his feelings for you. ",
    "If you wait until you can do everything for everybody, instead of something for somebody, you'll end up not doing anything for anybody. ",
    "The simple path: silence is prayer, prayer is faith, faith is love, love is service, the fruit of service is peace. ",
    "When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed. ",
    "Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. ",
    "An invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet, regardless of time, place, or circumstance. The thread may stretch or tangle, but will never break. ",
    "There are those whose lives affect all others around them. Quietly touching one heart, who in turn, touches another. Reaching out to ends further than they would ever know. ",
    "All things are bound together. All things connect. Whatever happens to the Earth happens to the children of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. ",
    "Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold. ",
    "Remember when you go into the world to keep your eyes and ears wide open. And be kind. Love one another. Take care of each other. Tell the truth. Always do your best. Listen to the big people and the little people. Explore new paths and have fun. Know that you are loved like crazy. Give thanks for all your blessings.

    "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. ",
    "Opportunities, many times, are so small that we glimpse them not and yet they are often the seeds of great enterprises. Opportunities are also everywhere and so you must always let your hook be hanging. When you least expect it, a great fish will swim by. ",
    "When you come to the edge of all the light you have, and must take a step into the darkness of the unknown, believe that one of two things will happen. Either there will be something solid for you to stand on - or you will be taught how to fly. ",

    "To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded. ",
    "Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved. ",
    "Does the sun ask itself, \"Am I good? Am I worthwhile? Is there enough of me?\" No, it burns and it shines. Does the sun ask itself, \"What does the moon think of me? How does Mars feel about me today?\" No it burns, it shines. Does the sun ask itself, \"Am I as big as other suns in other galaxies?\" No, it burns, it shines. ",

    "To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting. ",
    "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. ",
    "A true friend knows your weaknesses but shows you your strengths; feels your fears but fortifies your faith; sees your anxieties but frees your spirit; recognizes your disabilities but emphasizes your possibilities. ",
    "Perhaps the secret of living well is not in having all the answers but in pursuing unanswerable questions in good company. ",
    "A true friend is someone who thinks that you are a good egg even though he knows that you are slightly cracked. ",

    "Trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit. ",
    "Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow. ",
    "For each new morning with its light, For rest and shelter of the night, For health and food, for love and friends, For everything Thy goodness sends.\n ",
    "Giving is so often thought of in terms of the things we give, but our greatest giving is of our time, and kindness, and even comfort for those who need it. We look on these gifts as unimportant \u2013 until we need them. ",
    "Some people grumble that roses have thorns; I am grateful that thorns have roses. ",
    "Give yourself entirely to those around you. Be generous with your blessings. A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. ",

    "Good manners will open doors that the best education cannot. ",
    "Listening is an attitude of the heart, a genuine desire to be with another which both attracts and heals. ",
    "Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. ",

    "Now, feel. I am thee and thou art me and all of one is the other. And feel now. Thou hast no heart but mine. ",
    "It is man's social nature which distinguishes him from the brute creation. If it is his privilege to be independent, it is equally his duty to be inter-dependent. Only an arrogant man will claim to be independent of everybody else and be self-contained. ",
    "People can't be just tied together. They have to connect. Otherwise, they'll find themselves bound hand and foot. ",
    "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. ",
    "We spend precious hours fearing the inevitable. It would be wise to use that time adoring our families, cherishing our friends and living our lives. ",

    "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.  ",
    "As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out the present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love - even the most simple action.  ",

    "Your vision becomes clear when you look inside your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens. ",
    "There\u2019s something very freeing about losing the anchors that have always defined you. Frightening, sad, but exhilarating in a poignant way, as well. You\u2019re free to float to the moon and evaporate or sink to the bottom of the deepest ocean. But you\u2019re free to explore. Some people confuse that with drifting, I suppose. I like to think of it as growing. ",

    "Don\u2019t practice until you get it right. Practice until you can\u2019t get it wrong. ",

    "There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.  ",
    "This I know. This I believe with all my heart. If we want a free and peaceful world, if we want to make deserts bloom and man to grow to greater dignity as a human being we can do it!  ",
    "I cannot believe that the purpose of life is to be happy. I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be compassionate. It is, above all to matter, to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all. ",
    "Never forget that you are one of a kind. Never forget that if there weren't any need for you in all your uniqueness to be on this earth, you wouldn't be here in the first place. And never forget, no matter how overwhelming life's challenges and problems seem to be, that one person can make a difference in the world. In fact, it is always because of one person that all the changes that matter in the world come about. So be that one person. ",

    "To put the world right in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life; we must first set our hearts right. ",
    "Miss no single opportunity of making some small sacrifice, here by a smiling look, there by a kindly word; always doing the smallest right and doing it all for love.  ",
    "Remember that when you leave this earth, you can take with you nothing that you have received-only what you have given: a full heart enriched by honest service, love, sacrifice and courage. ",
    "Service is the rent we pay for being. It is the very purpose of life, and not something you do in your spare time. ",

    "The root of all health is in the brain. The trunk of it is in emotion. The branches and leaves are the body. The flower of health blooms when all parts work together. ",

    "He who has health, has hope; and he who has hope, has everything. ",
    "The moment when you first wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the twenty-four hours. No matter how weary or dreary you may feel, you possess the certainty that, during the day that lies before you, absolutely anything may happen. And the fact that it practically always doesn\u2019t matters not a jot. The possibility is always there. ",
    "Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find his right road. ",
    "All human beings should try to learn before they die what they are running from, and to, and why. ",
    "Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ",
    "Three grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for. ",
    "Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail. ",
    "Remember, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. ",
    "Love yourself, respect yourself. Never sell yourself short. Believe in yourself regardless of what other people think. You can accomplish anything, absolutely anything, if you set your mind to it. ",
    "This above all-to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as night follows day, thou canst not then be false to any man. ",
    "Don\u2019t ever let a soul in the world tell you that you can\u2019t be exactly who you are. ",
    "I don't want to live in the kind of world where we don't look out for each other. Not just the people that are close to us, but anybody who needs a helping hand. I can't change the way anybody else thinks, or what they choose to do, but I can do my bit. ",

    "Hard work is painful when life is devoid of purpose. But when you live for something greater than yourself and the gratification of your own ego, then hard work becomes a labor of love. ",
    "Freedom, morality, and the human dignity of the individual consists precisely in this; that he does good not because he is forced to do so, but because he freely conceives it, wants it, and loves it. ",
    "Your time is limited, so don\u2019t waste it living someone else's life. Don\u2019t be trapped by dogma- which is living with the results of other people\u2019s thinking. Don\u2019t let the noise of other\u2019s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. ",
    "The hero is one who kindles a great light in the world, who sets up blazing torches in the dark streets of life for men to see by. The saint is the man who walks through the dark paths of the world, himself a light. ",
    "If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in. ",

    "Comedy is defiance. It's a snort of contempt in the face of fear and anxiety. And it's the laughter that allows hope to creep back on the inhale. ",
    "Every piece of the universe, even the tiniest little snow crystal, matters somehow. I have a place in the pattern, and so do you. ",
    "Take a stand for what's right. Raise a ruckus and make a change. You may not always be popular, but you'll be part of something larger and bigger and greater than yourself. ",
    "There's something about love that people just have to respond to. "
